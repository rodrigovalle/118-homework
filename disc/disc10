MACAW
 - DIFS
 - SIFS
 - CSMA/CA

SMTP -- push, not like HTTP, which is pull
PGP/GPG -- authenticate your message with a key

SMTP -- assumes you can trust the mail server connections
 - hack, you can pretend to be an SMTP server and send emails from whoever

Mail Access protocols:
 - POP3, IMAP, HTTP

DNS
 - Architecture of DNS: scalable + cache
 - Records
 - Query/Reply
 - DNS dig

CDN - Akamai
Video Streaming protocols: DASH

Transport Protocols:
 - TCP
 - UDP: header fields, checksum (no checksum calculation)

Reliable Data Trasnfer
 - sequence numbers
 - acknowledgement
 - retransmission timer
 - go-back-n, sack, cumulative ack, etc.

TCP
 - header
 - handshake (3 way handshake) and teardown (fin, how to set final timeout,
   2 generals)
 - flow control (congestion control)

Setting TCP Retransmission Timer
 - SampleRTT, SRTT, DevRTT, RTO
 - Karn's algorithm -- don't consider ACKs for retransmitted packets

Fast Retransmit

Congestion Control

Throughput

Network Layer functionality (routing & forwarding)

Virtual Circuit & data gram (circuit switching vs packet switching)

IP datagram format
IP fragmentation (calculating the fragments of a very long TCP packet, fields,
                  flags: IF, MF, offset)
Subnet (CIDR prefix notation)
Special Addresses (IP classes A B C D, special IP classes, broadcast/network)
Longest Prefix matching 
NAT (Network Address Translation) (use port to map to inner hosts)
DHCP

IPv6 vs IPv4
IPv6 tunneling
ICMP/traceroute
Routing Algorithms
 - link state
 - distance vector

Count to Infinity
 - split horizon
 - split horizion + poison reverse

OSPF Protocol: packet fmt

Hierarchical architecture - Autonomous Systems
BGP: i-BGP, e-BGP
Even though you are within the same AS, need to know if intra-AS or i-BGP
if the original packet came from a different AS and propogates into your AS you
still use i-BGP
if you want to learn about other routers, OSPF

Link Layer: Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast
Where LL is implemented
Byte stuffing: HDLC, PPP, COBS

Multiple access protocols
channel partition: FDM, TDM, CDMA,
Random access: aloha, slotted aloha, CSMA (know efficiency, eg ALOHA 1/2e)
Taking turns: tokens
1 persistent, p persistent, etc.

Ethernet - Bus and start topo
MAC Address
Ethernet frame structure
ARP IP address to MAC address
Plug and Play
Soft state
difference between hub switch router
switching forwarding table
self learning

wireless & mobile
-------------------
Cellular network: core difference from wifi, network tries to assign network
channel to a user, very fine grained control

full overview
-------------
DHCP:
 - send UDP packet with broadcast ethernet frame to router
 - unicast (ethernet) back to your device

ARP query

DNS

send TCP SYN
responds with TCP SYNACK

ask for page with HTTP get
send HTTP response
